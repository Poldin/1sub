# 1Sub Vendor Docs

1Sub lets you monetize your tool without building billing infrastructure. Users subscribe on 1Sub, click "Launch Tool", and your app knows who they are and what they paid for.

  Integrate in 30-60 minutes with ~40 lines of code
</Card>

## How It Works

1. **User subscribes** on 1Sub to your tool
2. **User launches** your tool from their 1Sub dashboard
3. **You receive** the user's identity and subscription details
4. **You check** access every 5 minutes
5. **We notify you** immediately when subscriptions change

You handle the product. We handle the payments.
