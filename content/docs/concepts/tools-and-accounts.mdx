# Tools and User Accounts

1Sub handles user identity and subscriptions for you. Users never create accounts on your site.

---

## How It Works

1. User subscribes to your tool on 1Sub
2. User clicks "Launch Tool"
3. Your app receives a code containing their identity
4. You create a session - that's it

Users are automatically identified. No account creation, no passwords, no email verification.

---

## User Identity

Every user has a unique `onesubUserId` that you receive when they launch your tool:

```typescript
const data = await exchangeCode(code);

// Store this - it identifies the user
const userId = data.onesubUserId;
```

Use this ID to:
- Identify the user across sessions
- Store user-specific data in your database
- Track usage and entitlements

---

## Tool Configuration

Configure your tool in the [vendor dashboard](https://1sub.io/vendor/dashboard):

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Callback URL** | Where users land after clicking "Launch Tool" |
| **Webhook URL** | Where you receive subscription events |
| **API Key** | For authenticating your requests |
| **Webhook Secret** | For verifying webhook signatures |

## What You Handle

- Session management (after receiving the user)
- Your app's features
- Access control based on entitlements
- User-specific data storage

## User Management

Users manage their accounts entirely on 1Sub:
- Subscribe/unsubscribe
- Update payment methods
- View billing history
- Cancel subscriptions

You just verify access and serve your features.
