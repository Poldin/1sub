# Vendor Payouts & Revenue

Learn how you get paid as a 1Sub vendor, including payout schedules, revenue calculations, and Stripe Connect integration.

## Revenue Flow Overview

Understanding how money flows from your users to you:

<Steps>
<Step title="User makes a purchase">
  User subscribes, buys credits, or makes a one-time purchase on 1Sub.
</Step>

<Step title="Payment is processed">
  1Sub processes the payment through Stripe and holds the funds.
</Step>

<Step title="Revenue is calculated">
  Your share is calculated based on the revenue split model.
</Step>

<Step title="Payout is scheduled">
  Funds are queued for the next payout cycle.
</Step>

<Step title="You receive payment">
  Money is transferred to your Stripe Connect account and then to your bank.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Revenue Share Model

<Note>
**Vendor Revenue Share:** Vendors keep **[XX%]** of all revenue. 1Sub's platform fee is **[XX%]** to cover payment processing, infrastructure, and support.
</Note>

### What's Included in Your Share

You earn from all revenue types:
- **Subscriptions:** Monthly/annual recurring payments
- **Credits:** User credit purchases
- **One-Time Purchases:** Lifetime access sales

### Fee Breakdown

```
User Payment:           €100.00
Stripe Processing Fee:  - €3.20  (2.9% + $0.30)
1Sub Platform Fee:      - €15.00  ([15%] of net)
────────────────────────────────
Your Net Revenue:       €81.80
```

<Warning>
Stripe processing fees (2.9% + €0.30 per transaction) are deducted before calculating vendor revenue share.
</Warning>

## Setting Up Payouts

Before you can receive payments, you need to connect your Stripe account.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Vendor Dashboard">
  Log into your vendor dashboard at https://1sub.io/vendor-dashboard
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Payouts">
  Go to Settings → Payouts & Banking
</Step>

<Step title="Connect Stripe Account">
  Click "Connect Stripe Account" and complete the Stripe Connect onboarding:

  **Required Information:**
  - Business type (Individual or Company)
  - Legal business name
  - Tax ID (SSN for individuals, EIN for businesses)
  - Bank account details
  - Business address
  - Date of birth (for identity verification)
</Step>

<Step title="Verify your identity">
  Stripe will verify your information. This usually takes 1-2 business days.
</Step>

<Step title="Start receiving payouts">
  Once verified, you'll automatically receive payouts according to the schedule below.
</Step>
</Steps>

You can use an existing Stripe account or create a new one during onboarding. Individual (sole proprietor) setup is fastest.

## Understanding Your Revenue

### Viewing Earnings

Access your earnings dashboard at: **Vendor Dashboard → Revenue**

**Available Views:**
- Real-time revenue tracking
- Revenue by monetization type (subscriptions, credits, one-time)
- Revenue by tool (if you have multiple tools)
- Monthly/annual trends
- Top customers (anonymized)

### Revenue Calculations

#### Subscription Revenue

Monthly subscriptions are recognized when the user is charged:

```typescript
User subscribes to $10/month plan on Dec 1
→ You earn €8.5 on Dec 1 (after fees)
→ You earn €8.5 on Jan 1 (renewal)
→ You earn €8.5 on Feb 1 (renewal)
```

Annual subscriptions are paid upfront:

```typescript
User subscribes to €100/year plan on Dec 1
→ You earn €81.80 immediately (full year, after fees)
```

#### Credit Revenue

Credits are recognized when purchased, not when consumed:

```typescript
User buys 1,000 credits for €50 on Dec 1
→ You earn €850 on Dec 1 (even if credits not used yet)

User consumes 100 credits on Dec 15
→ No additional revenue (already recognized at purchase)
```

#### One-Time Purchase Revenue

Lifetime access is recognized immediately:

```typescript
User pays €99 for lifetime access on Dec 1
→ You earn €80 on Dec 1 (one-time, full amount after fees)
