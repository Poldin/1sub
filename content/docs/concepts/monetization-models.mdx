## Subscription Model

Subscriptions provide recurring revenue from users who pay monthly or annually for access to your tool.

### When to Use Subscriptions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Best For" icon="check">
  - **SaaS platforms** with continuous access
  - **Content platforms** with regular updates
  - **Productivity tools** used daily/weekly
  - **Team collaboration tools**
  - **Tools with ongoing costs** (hosting, APIs)
</Card>

<Card title="Not Ideal For" icon="x">
  - **One-time use tools** (converters, generators)
  - **CLI tools** without ongoing updates
  - **Seasonal tools** used infrequently
  - **Simple utilities** without continuous value
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Pricing Strategies

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Single Plan">
**Simple and focused**

```
Basic Plan: $10/month
- All features included
- Unlimited usage
- Email support
```

**Pros:** Easy to understand, low friction
**Cons:** Leaves money on the table from power users
</Tab>

<Tab title="Tiered Plans">
**Maximize revenue from different user segments**

```
Starter:     $10/month
  - 100 requests/day
  - Email support

Pro:         $25/month
  - 1,000 requests/day
  - Priority support
  - Advanced features

Enterprise:  $99/month
  - Unlimited requests
  - Dedicated support
  - Custom integrations
```

**Pros:** Captures more revenue, serves diverse needs
**Cons:** More complex, requires feature gating
</Tab>

<Tab title="Usage Tiers">
**Scale pricing with usage**

```
Light:    $5/month   (up to 50 uses)
Regular:  $15/month  (up to 500 uses)
Heavy:    $50/month  (unlimited)
```

**Pros:** Fair pricing based on value
**Cons:** Users may downgrade to save money
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Revenue Example

```
100 users × $10/month = $1,000 MRR
Annual value: $12,000

With 10% monthly churn:
Year 1: $10,800 (after churn)
Year 2: $9,720 (compounding churn)
```

### Implementation

```typescript
// Verify subscription before granting access
async function checkAccess(userId: string) {
  const sub = await verifySubscription(oneSubUserId);

  if (!sub.active) {
    throw new Error('Active subscription required');
  }

  // Check plan tier
  if (sub.planId === 'starter' && isAdvancedFeature) {
    throw new Error('Upgrade to Pro for this feature');
  }

  // Grant access
  return true;
}
```

## Credit Model

Credits allow users to pay upfront for a balance they consume as they use your tool.

### When to Use Credits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Best For" icon="check">
  - **API services** (translation, image generation)
  - **AI/ML tools** with compute costs
  - **Usage-based tools** (file conversions, analyses)
  - **Variable usage patterns**
  - **Pay-per-action workflows**
</Card>

<Card title="Not Ideal For" icon="x">
  - **Unlimited usage tools**
  - **Binary access** (all or nothing)
  - **Tools with fixed costs**
  - **Simple SaaS dashboards**
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Pricing Strategies

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Fixed Cost per Action">
**Simple and transparent**

```
1 credit = 1 API call
1 credit = 1 image generation
1 credit = 1 report

Pricing:
100 credits  = $10  ($0.10 each)
500 credits  = $40  ($0.08 each)
2,000 credits = $120 ($0.06 each)
```

**Pros:** Easy to understand, predictable
**Cons:** Doesn't account for complexity differences
</Tab>

<Tab title="Variable Cost by Complexity">
**Fair pricing based on resource usage**

```
Small image (512×512):     5 credits
Large image (1024×1024):   10 credits
HD image (2048×2048):      25 credits

Short text (<100 words):   1 credit
Long text (>1000 words):   5 credits
```

**Pros:** Fair pricing, encourages efficient usage
**Cons:** More complex for users to estimate costs
</Tab>

<Tab title="Bulk Discounts">
**Encourage larger purchases**

```
Starter Pack:   100 credits  = $15  ($0.15 each)
Value Pack:     500 credits  = $60  ($0.12 each)
Power Pack:     2,000 credits = $200 ($0.10 each)
```

**Pros:** Increases average order value
**Cons:** Users may wait for discounts
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Revenue Example

```
1,000 users averaging 50 credits/month
= 50,000 credits/month

At $0.10/credit = $5,000/month

Highly variable based on:
- User activity
- Credit pricing
- Bulk vs individual purchases
```

### Implementation

```typescript
// Consume credits for each action
async function generateImage(userId: string, size: string) {
  const CREDIT_COSTS = {
    'small': 5,
    'large': 10,
    'hd': 25,
  };

  const cost = CREDIT_COSTS[size];

  // Consume credits BEFORE performing action
  await consumeCredits({
    user_id: oneSubUserId,
    amount: cost,
    reason: `Generated ${size} image`,
    idempotency_key: `img-${userId}-${Date.now()}`,
  });

  // Perform action
  const image = await yourImageService.generate(size);
  return image;
}
```

## One-Time Purchase Model

Users pay once for lifetime access to your tool without recurring charges.

### When to Use One-Time Purchases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Best For" icon="check">
  - **Desktop applications**
  - **CLI tools** and utilities
  - **Mobile apps**
  - **Templates and themes**
  - **Educational content/courses**
  - **Tools with minimal ongoing costs**
</Card>

<Card title="Not Ideal For" icon="x">
  - **SaaS with high server costs**
  - **Tools requiring constant updates**
  - **API services** with per-use costs
  - **Team collaboration platforms**
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Pricing Strategies

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Simple Lifetime">
**Single price for all features**

```
$99 one-time payment
- Lifetime access
- All features
- Free updates for v1.x
```

**Pros:** Simple, attractive to users
**Cons:** No recurring revenue
</Tab>

<Tab title="Tiered Lifetime">
**Different levels of lifetime access**

```
Personal:  $49  (single user, basic features)
Pro:       $99  (single user, all features)
Team:      $299 (5 users, all features)
```

**Pros:** Captures more revenue from different segments
**Cons:** More complex, may cannibalize higher tiers
</Tab>

<Tab title="Version-Based">
**Lifetime for current version only**

```
v1.x Lifetime: $99
- Free updates within v1.x
- 50% discount on v2.0 upgrade

v2.x Lifetime: $129 (when released)
- Free for v1.x lifetime buyers
```

**Pros:** Creates future upgrade revenue
**Cons:** May frustrate users expecting true lifetime
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Revenue Example

```
50 purchases/month × $99 = $4,950/month

Year 1: $59,400
Year 2: $59,400 (if sales maintain)
BUT: No recurring revenue from existing users
```

### Implementation

```typescript
// Verify lifetime access
async function checkAccess(userId: string) {
  const sub = await verifySubscription(oneSubUserId);

  if (!sub.hasLifetimeAccess) {
    throw new Error('Lifetime purchase required');
  }

  // Grant full access
  return true;
}

// Handle purchase webhook
webhookHandler.on('purchase.completed', async (event) => {
  await db.users.update(event.data.oneSubUserId, {
    hasLifetimeAccess: true,
    purchaseDate: event.data.purchaseDate,
  });

  await sendWelcomeEmail(event.data.oneSubUserId);
});
```

## Hybrid Models

Combine multiple monetization models for maximum flexibility and revenue.

### Common Hybrid Patterns

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Subscription + Credits">
**Base access + usage charges**

```
Monthly Subscription: $10/month
  - Access to platform
  - 100 included credits/month
  - Credits reset monthly

Additional Credits: $0.10 each
  - Buy more when you run out
  - Never expire
```

**Example Tools:**
- AI writing assistant (subscription for access, credits for generations)
- Analytics platform (subscription for dashboard, credits for data exports)

**Pros:**
- Recurring revenue from subscriptions
- Additional revenue from power users
- Fair pricing for light users

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function generateContent(userId: string) {
  const sub = await verifySubscription(oneSubUserId);

  if (!sub.active) {
    throw new Error('Subscription required');
  }

  // Check included credits first
  if (sub.creditsRemaining > 0) {
    // Use included credits (tracked by 1Sub)
    await consumeIncludedCredits(oneSubUserId, 1);
  } else {
    // Fall back to purchased credits
    await consumeCredits({
      user_id: oneSubUserId,
      amount: 1,
      reason: 'Generated content',
      idempotency_key: `gen-${userId}-${Date.now()}`,
    });
  }

  return await generateAIContent();
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="One-Time + Credits">
**Lifetime access + pay-per-use**

```
Lifetime License: $99 one-time
  - Lifetime platform access
  - No monthly fees

Credits: $10 = 100 credits
  - Used for premium features
  - API calls, generations, etc.
```

**Example Tools:**
- Image editor (lifetime for app, credits for AI features)
- Code tool (lifetime for core features, credits for AI assistance)

**Pros:**
- No ongoing subscription friction
- Revenue from feature usage
- Works well for desktop apps

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function useAIFeature(userId: string) {
  const sub = await verifySubscription(oneSubUserId);

  // Check lifetime access OR active subscription
  if (!sub.hasLifetimeAccess && !sub.active) {
    throw new Error('Purchase or subscription required');
  }

  // Consume credits for premium feature
  await consumeCredits({
    user_id: oneSubUserId,
    amount: 10,
    reason: 'Used AI feature',
    idempotency_key: `ai-${userId}-${Date.now()}`,
  });

  return await performAIOperation();
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Freemium + Subscription">
**Free tier + paid upgrades**

```
Free: $0
  - Basic features
  - 10 uses/month

Pro: $10/month
  - All features
  - Unlimited use
```

**Example Tools:**
- Most SaaS products
- API platforms

**Pros:**
- Easy user acquisition
- Proven conversion funnel
- Viral growth potential

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function checkFeatureAccess(userId: string, feature: string) {
  const sub = await verifySubscription(oneSubUserId);

  // Free tier limits
  if (!sub.active) {
    const usage = await getMonthlyUsage(userId);
    if (usage >= 10) {
      throw new Error('Free tier limit reached. Upgrade to Pro.');
    }

    if (feature === 'advanced') {
      throw new Error('Pro subscription required for advanced features.');
    }
  }

  // Pro users have full access
  return true;
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Decision Framework

Use this decision tree to choose your monetization model:

```
What type of tool are you building?
│
├─ SaaS / Web App
│  │
│  ├─ Do you have ongoing server costs?
│  │  ├─ Yes → Subscription (or Subscription + Credits for usage)
│  │  └─ No → Consider One-Time or Freemium
│  │
│  └─ Is usage variable (some users use 10x more than others)?
│     ├─ Yes → Credits (or Subscription + Credits)
│     └─ No → Subscription
│
├─ Desktop / CLI Tool
│  │
│  ├─ Do you need recurring revenue?
│  │  ├─ Yes → Subscription (harder sell for desktop)
│  │  └─ No → One-Time Purchase
│  │
│  └─ Do you have usage-based costs (API calls, etc.)?
│     ├─ Yes → One-Time + Credits
│     └─ No → One-Time Purchase
│
└─ API / Usage-Based Service
   │
   └─ → Credits (or Subscription + Credits for base access)
```

## Migration Strategies

### Changing Models Without Losing Users

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Credits → Subscription">
**Problem:** Want predictable recurring revenue instead of variable credit sales.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Grandfather existing credit users
// Offer subscription with monthly credit allowance

if (user.hasExistingCredits) {
  // Let them use remaining credits
  // Offer: "Switch to Pro and get 500 credits/month for $20"
} else {
  // New users must subscribe
}
```

**Communication:**
"We're moving to a subscription model! Your existing credits never expire, and you can continue using them. Or upgrade to Pro and get 500 credits every month for $20."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="One-Time → Subscription">
**Problem:** Need recurring revenue to sustain the business.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Grandfather lifetime users with equivalent plan

if (user.hasLifetimeAccess && user.purchasedBefore('2025-01-01')) {
  // Grant Pro subscription forever
  user.grandfatheredPlan = 'pro-lifetime';
} else {
  // New users must subscribe
}
```

**Communication:**
"To continue development, we're moving to subscriptions. All lifetime license holders get free Pro subscriptions forever as a thank you!"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Subscription → Credits">
**Problem:** Users want pay-as-you-go instead of recurring commitment.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Convert remaining subscription time to credits

if (user.active && user.planId === 'monthly') {
  const daysRemaining = getDaysUntilRenewal(user);
  const creditValue = (10 / 30) * daysRemaining; // $10/month prorated

  // Grant credits, cancel subscription
  await grantCredits(user, creditValue * 100); // 100 credits per $1
  await cancelSubscription(user);
}
```

**Communication:**
"We're switching to credits! We've converted your remaining subscription time to credits so you don't lose any value."
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
