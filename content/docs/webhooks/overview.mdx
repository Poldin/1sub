# Webhooks

Webhooks notify you instantly when something changes - like a user canceling their subscription. This lets you revoke access immediately instead of waiting for the next access check.

---

## Setup

1. Add a webhook endpoint to your app
2. Enter the URL in your [vendor dashboard](https://1sub.io/vendor/dashboard)
3. Save the webhook secret we provide

---

## Handle Events

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure webhook URL">
  Set your webhook endpoint in the 1Sub vendor dashboard:
  
```
https://yourtool.com/webhooks/1sub
```
</Step>

<Step title="Event occurs">
  User subscribes, cancels, or updates their subscription on 1Sub.
</Step>

<Step title="1Sub sends HTTP POST">
  We send a POST request to your webhook URL with event details:
  
```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "type": "subscription.activated",
  "created": 1700000000,
  "data": {
    "oneSubUserId": "uuid-abc-123",
    "userEmail": "user@example.com",
    "planId": "monthly",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="You verify and process">
  Your endpoint verifies the signature and processes the event:
  
```typescript
// Verify signature
if (!verifySignature(payload, signature)) {
  return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
}

// Process event
const event = JSON.parse(payload);
handleSubscriptionEvent(event);

// Acknowledge receipt
res.json({ received: true });
```
</Step>

<Step title="Return 2xx response">
  Return any 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt. We'll retry if you don't.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhooks follow this structure:

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
Unique event identifier (format: `evt_xxxxx`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
Event type: `subscription.activated`, `subscription.updated`, or `subscription.canceled`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created" type="number" required>
Unix timestamp when the event was created
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object" required>
Event-specific data about the subscription change

<Expandable title="Common Data Fields">
  <ResponseField name="oneSubUserId" type="string (UUID)" required>
  The 1Sub user ID
  </ResponseField>
  
  <ResponseField name="userEmail" type="string">
  The user's email address (included in all user-specific events)

  <ResponseField name="currentPeriodEnd" type="string (ISO 8601)">

## Security

Webhooks include an HMAC signature in the `1sub-signature` header to prove authenticity.

```http
1sub-signature: t=1700000000,v1=abcdef123456789...
```

**Always verify signatures before processing webhooks!**

<Warning>
Never process webhooks without signature verification. This prevents attackers from sending fake events.
</Warning>

See [Security and Signing](/webhooks/security-and-signing) for implementation details.

## Delivery Guarantees

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="At-least-once delivery">
We guarantee each event will be delivered **at least once**. In rare cases (network issues, retries), you may receive duplicate events.

**Mitigation:** Use the event `id` to deduplicate:
