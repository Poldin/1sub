</Step>

<Step title="Implement authentication">
  Link user accounts via email-based verification (for SaaS) or link codes (for CLI/desktop apps).
</Step>

<Step title="Verify subscriptions">

</Step>

<Step title="Set up webhooks">
  Receive real-time notifications when subscriptions are activated, updated, or canceled.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Patterns

Choose the integration pattern that best fits your tool:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Subscription-Based">
  **Best for:** SaaS tools with recurring access

  - Users subscribe to plans on 1Sub
  - Verify subscription status via API
  - Receive webhook notifications on changes
  - Support tiered plans with different features
</Tab>

<Tab title="Credit-Based">
  **Best for:** Usage-based tools (API calls, generations, etc.)

  - Users purchase credit packages on 1Sub
  - Consume credits for each tool usage
  - Real-time balance tracking
  - Automatic refunds on failures
</Tab>

<Tab title="One-Time Purchase">
  **Best for:** Desktop apps, CLI tools, lifetime access

  - Users pay once for permanent access
  - No recurring billing complexity
  - Simple user experience
  - Higher upfront revenue per user
</Tab>

<Tab title="Hybrid">
  **Best for:** Tools with base access + usage charges

  - Subscription or one-time purchase grants base access
  - Credits used for premium features
  - Best of all models
</Tab>
</Tabs>
