## Integration Overview

The integration process follows these simple steps:

</Step>

<Step title="Implement authentication">
  Handle user redirects from 1Sub and verify JWT tokens using our JWKS endpoint.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify subscriptions">

</Step>

<Step title="Set up webhooks">
  Receive real-time notifications when subscriptions are activated, updated, or canceled.

## Integration Patterns

Choose the integration pattern that best fits your tool:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Subscription-Based">
  **Best for:** SaaS tools with recurring access

  - Users subscribe to plans on 1Sub
  - Verify subscription status via API
  - Receive webhook notifications on changes
  - Support tiered plans with different features
</Tab>

<Tab title="Credit-Based">
  **Best for:** Usage-based tools (API calls, generations, etc.)

  - Users purchase credit packages on 1Sub
  - Consume credits for each tool usage
  - Real-time balance tracking
  - Automatic refunds on failures
</Tab>

<Tab title="Hybrid">
  **Best for:** Tools with base access + usage charges

  - Subscription grants base access
  - Credits used for premium features
  - Best of both models
</Tab>
</Tabs>
